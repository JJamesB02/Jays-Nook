Text=Dear #System.UserName#,#CRLF##CRLF#NXT-OS was developed by me, mrsalogo, in my free time over the years. With the help of the awesome Rainmeter community NXT-OS has evolved in to something much bigger than I could have initially imagined. It has taught me things about programming and interface design that I will use for years to come. But as with all great things, the time has come to sunset NXT-OS.#CRLF##CRLF#This will be last version of NXT-OS that I will release. I will no longer be adding features or fixing any bugs. I've removed all of the broken internet connected features. These features required constant bug fixes and updates to ensure that they kept working. They were removed in hopes that NXT-OS can be used for the years to come without any intervention and so that new users are not greeted by broken features.#CRLF##CRLF#And while it's not currently documented, NXT-OS was built from the ground up to be expanded and built upon. Many aspects of NXT-OS are modular and were built on frameworks so that the community can work on it for years to come.#CRLF##CRLF#Whether you have been using NXT-OS for years or this is the first time you have used NXT-OS, thank you for your support.#CRLF##CRLF#Enjoy!#CRLF#- mrsalogo
